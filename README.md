# c19-rnd-dashboard-ui
The react application for the frontend of the covid 19 dashboard application

Inside the dashboard directory, you can run several commands:

  "yarn start"
    Starts the development server.

  "yarn build"
    Bundles the app into static files for production.

  "yarn test"
    Starts the test runner.

  "yarn eject"
    Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files
    and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you canâ€™t go back!

We suggest that you begin by typing:

  cd dashboard && yarn start
  
  NOTE: you may also need to do a 'yarn install' the first time you download and run the repo.
